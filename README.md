## Rules  


### 0) Snail Numeric  

This rule contains @ and then 0-9 up to 9999 numbers. I have got a lot of hits with this.  
The rule would look like this: @243 in end when adding to the wordlist.

### 1) Snail Numeric First Uppercase  

This rule is exactly like Snail Numeric BUT will use the first character a-z and convert to A-Z.  
Also an uppercase converting on the first character.
